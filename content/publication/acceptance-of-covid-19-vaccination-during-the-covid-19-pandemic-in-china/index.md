abstract: "Background: Faced with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
  pandemic, the development of COVID-19 vaccines has been progressing at an
  unprecedented rate. This study aimed to evaluate the acceptance of COVID-19
  vaccination in China and give suggestions for vaccination strategies and
  immunization programs accordingly. Methods: In March 2020, an anonymous
  cross-sectional survey was conducted online among Chinese adults. The
  questionnaire collected socio-demographic characteristics, risk perception,
  the impact of COVID-19, attitudes, acceptance and attribute preferences of
  vaccines against COVID-19 during the pandemic. Multivariate logistic
  regression was performed to identify the influencing factors of vaccination
  acceptance. Results: Of the 2058 participants surveyed, 1879 (91.3%) stated
  that they would accept COVID-19 vaccination after the vaccine becomes
  available, among whom 980 (52.2%) wanted to get vaccinated as soon as
  possible, while others (47.8%) would delay the vaccination until the vaccine’s
  safety was confirmed. Participants preferred a routine immunization schedule
  (49.4%) to emergency vaccination (9.0%) or either of them (41.6%). Logistic
  regression showed that being male, being married, perceiving a high risk of
  infection, being vaccinated against influenza in the past season, believing in
  the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination or valuing doctor’s recommendations could
  increase the probability of accepting COVID-19 vaccination as soon as
  possible, while having confirmed or suspected cases in local areas, valuing
  vaccination convenience or vaccine price in decision-making could hinder
  participants from immediate vaccination. Conclusion: During the pandemic
  period, a strong demand for and high acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination has
  been shown among the Chinese population, while concerns about vaccine safety
  may hinder the promotion of vaccine uptake. To expand vaccination coverage,
  immunization programs should be designed to remove barriers in terms of
  vaccine price and vaccination convenience, and health education and
  communication from authoritative sources are important ways to alleviate
  public concerns about vaccine safety."
