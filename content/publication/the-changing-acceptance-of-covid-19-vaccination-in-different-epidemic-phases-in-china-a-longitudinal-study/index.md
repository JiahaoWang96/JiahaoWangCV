abstract: COVID-19 vaccines have been conditionally used in a few countries,
  including China since December 2020. The present study aimed to examine
  whether the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination changed in different COVID-19
  epidemic phases in China. Two consecutive surveys were conducted among Chinese
  adults in March (n = 2058) (severe epidemic phase) and November–December (n =
  2013) (well-contained phase, right before the COVID-19 vaccine was
  conditionally approved) 2020, and 791 respondents were longitudinally
  followed-up. The attitude, acceptance, and preferences for future COVID-19
  vaccination were compared between two epidemic phases. Multivariate logistic
  regression was used to identify influencing factors of acceptance. Among the
  791 respondents longitudinally followed, 91.9% in March and 88.6% of them in
  November–December 2020 would like to get COVID-19 vaccination in China. In
  March 58.3% wished to get vaccinated immediately, but the proportion declined
  to 23.0% in November–December 2020, because more respondents wanted to delay
  vaccination until the vaccine’s safety was confirmed. Similar results were
  found by comparing all respondents from the two cross-sectional surveys in
  different epidemic phases. The risk perception, attitude for the importance of
  vaccination against COVID-19, vaccination history, valuing doctor’s
  recommendations, vaccination convenience, or vaccine price in decision-making
  had impacts on respondents’ intention for immediate vaccination. The public
  acceptance for COVID-19 vaccination in China sustained at a high level in
  different COVID-19 epidemic phases. However, the intention of immediate
  vaccination declined substantially due to concerns about the vaccine’s safety.
  Information about vaccination safety from authoritative sources, doctor’s
  recommendations, and vaccination convenience were important in addressing
  vaccine hesitancy and promoting successful herd immunity for the general
  population in China.
