**Public Health Impact and Cost-effectiveness of Rotavirus Vaccination in China: Comparison Between Private-sector Provision Only and a Potential National Immunization Program**

**Background:** WHO has strongly recommended introduction of rotavirus (RV) vaccination in all national immunization programs, and significant reduction of the disease burden of RV gastroenteritis in children under 5 has been observed among countries that have introduced RV vaccines. However, the pace of introduction was relatively slow among countries in the Western Pacific Regions, and the lack of high-quality, local epidemiology and economic evidence remains a big obstacle. With a large population base, China contributes substantially to the regional disease and economic burden of RV gastroenteritis, but a mass vaccination program has not been launched. Only two RV vaccines are available in China, Rotateq and Lanzhou lamb rotavirus vaccine (LLR) by a domestic manufacturer, and parents are required to pay full payment in the private market for RV vaccines, resulting in a low immunization coverage. With a fully-constructed evaluation model and renewed clinical, epidemiological and economic data, this study evaluates the public health and economic impact of a potential national immunization program with possible RV vaccines that were either widely used globally (Rotateq, Rotarix) or available domestically (LLR), compared with the current private-market scenario in China.

**Methods**: From a societal perspective, an economic evaluation was conducted using a decision tree-Markov model. Following the Chinese birth cohort in 2017 for 5 years, the model allowed repeated RV infections in individuals, and varied probabilities of use of health services (home care, inpatient or outpatient settings) by age, symptom severity, times of infections and protection by vaccination or natural infections. Parameters including demographic, diseases epidemiological and costs (direct and indirect) data, vaccines efficacy, cost and coverage were obtained from published literature specific for China, or estimated to reflect the local situation. Outcome measures included the prevented rotavirus gastroenteritis episodes, deaths, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is presented. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted to account for the uncertainty of parameters. Outcome and costs were discounted at a 3% annual rate.

**Results**: Compared to the current scenario of private-sector provision, a national immunization program using Rotateq would prevent 410 deaths, 0.47 million hospitalizations, and 3.54 million outpatient visits, and 1.63 million home care cases, with additional cost about $1.7 billion. Rotarix vaccination prevented 312 deaths and 4.72 million episodes with additional $1.5 billion cost. LLR vaccination prevented 148 deaths and 1.97 million episodes with additional $1.0 billion cost. The ICERs of the three vaccines were all less than one times GDP of China, and the ICER of Rotateq was the lowest, $3387.0/QALY, compared with that of Rotarix, $3803.2/QALY and LLR, $7277.5/QALY.Â 

**Conclusions**: A national immunization program with the rotavirus vaccine would substantially reduce rotavirus morbidity and mortality in China, and it is highly cost-effective, compared with status quo. Policy makers should seriously consider prioritizing the introduction of rotavirus vaccine into the national immunization program.
