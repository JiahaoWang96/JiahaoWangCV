The Changing Acceptance of COVID-19 Vaccination in Different Epidemic Phases in China: A Longitudinal Study

Background: COVID-19 vaccination is of great importance in preventing and controlling the pandemic. Since China have contained COVID-19 quite well, however, it is needed to examine whether the vaccination acceptance changed compared with the previous severe epidemic, to better prepare for a national vaccination program.

Methods: Two consecutive online surveys were conducted among Chinese adults in March (N=2058) and November-December (N=2013) 2020, with [791 respondents longitudinally followed up](<>). Acceptance and perception of COVID-19 vaccination among respondents were compared between two epidemic phases. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify influencing factors of vaccination acceptance based on the longitudinal and cross-sectional samples.

Results:[](<>) [Among respondents longitudinally followed, vaccination intention rate declined to 88.6% in November-December 2020, right before COVID-19 vaccines were approved, in China, from 91.9% in March. The proportion who wished to get vaccinated immediately declined significantly from 58.3% in March to 23.0% in November-December, with more respondents wanted to delay the vaccination until vaccine safety was confirmed. Perceiving high infection risk, valuing the vaccination importance and doctor recommendations increased the probability of accepting immediate vaccination, while having history of refusing any vaccination, having confirmed or suspected cases locally, valuing convenience and vaccine price on vaccination decision hinder participants from immediate vaccination.](<>)[](<>)

[Conclusion: Though public vaccination acceptance sustained at a high level in China in different epidemic period, comprehensive interventions should be conducted to address the substantial declination in the intention of immediate vaccination by concerns about vaccine safety, including promoting public information about vaccination safety from authoritative sources, doctorâ€™s recommendations, and vaccination convenience.](<>)
