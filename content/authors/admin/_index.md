Hi! I am a master candidate in social medicine and health service management, with a concentration in health economics, at Peking University. 
My mentor is Prof. Hai Fang at China Center for Health Development Studies, who is also the deputy director of PKU-Chinese CDC Joint Center for Vaccine Economics.

My present interests of study are: 

* Assessing the impact of social determinants (e.g. social network, environmental planning, etc. ) on health; 
* Modeling the time and spatial trends of the disease incidence; 
* Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of potential strategies enhancing population health.

My recent works focus on: 

1. Addressing public vaccine hesitancy and designing strategies to promote COVID-19 vaccine uptake in China by longitudinal surveys and multidisciplinary perspectives (e.g., epidemiology, economics, health behavior, and policy-planning); 
2. Conducting the economic evaluation of national and regional rotavirus vaccination programs for children under 5, depicting disparity of regional and population in vaccine coverage and health outcomes.
3. Examining the impact of policy (China Healthy Cities Initiative) on population health with an attempt to incorporate data at individual, community, and regional levels.
